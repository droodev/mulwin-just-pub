mul-win-just-pub makes use of a nonfree library gurobipy which is an API to
a nonfree ILP solver Gurobi. This is certainly a drawback of this software. The
software should be changed to do the same job without the nonfree library.
Specifically, Gurobi should be replcaed by an open-source ILP solver.
